## Problem Statement
Todo Manager is an application, which can manage our Tasks and keep track of our Tasks. In 
the course of 3 week, we will be creating a Todo manager.
## User Stories:-
1. As a user, I should be able to register and login to the application.
2. As a user, I can be either the client or visitor.
3. AS a visitor I can only see the tasks assigned to me
4. As a client I should be able to add the task into an array
5. As a client I should be able to update the task in the array
6. As a client I should be able to delete the task in the array
7. As a client I should be able to search a task from an array
8. As a client, I should be able to assign the task to a visitor. 
## Instructions:-
1. Please refactor the code created in sprint 3.
2. Please create a user as a parent class and client and visitor should be child classes.
3. Please use arrays to store the user objects
4. All the CRUD operations should happen in a dao class. Main should contain only 
menu.
5. please use userDAO and taskDAO interfaces and userDAOimpl and taskDAOImpl as 
classes implements the interface
6. The application can be exited only if user enters 0 to exit. Else, user should see the 
menu repeatedly
